# Stock Prediction

### Project Description
This project predicts stock prices of selected companies using historical stock data and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. By analyzing past trends and patterns in stock prices, we leverage machine learning techniques to forecast future stock prices accurately.

### Key Features
- **Data Collection and Preparation:** Retrieve historical stock data using Yahoo Finance API and preprocess it for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize and analyze stock price trends, volume of sales, moving averages, daily returns, and correlations between stocks.
- **Risk Analysis:** Assess expected returns versus risk for selected stocks to inform investment decisions.
- **LSTM Model Implementation:** Build and train LSTM models to learn from historical stock data and predict future stock prices.
- **Visualization of Predictions:** Plot actual stock prices against predicted prices to evaluate model performance visually.

### Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
- TensorFlow and Keras for building and training LSTM models.
- Yahoo Finance API for retrieving historical stock data.

### Repository Structure
- **Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks containing data preprocessing, model building, and analysis.
- **Scripts:** Python scripts for specific tasks like data retrieval and model training.
- **Documentation:** Readme files and documentation explaining project setup, usage, and findings.
- **Visualizations:** Folder containing visualizations generated during EDA and model evaluation.

### Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up Python environment with necessary dependencies.
3. Explore the notebooks for detailed analysis and model implementation.
4. Run scripts to replicate data collection and model training.
5. Modify and experiment with models to apply to other stocks or timeframes.

### Future Improvements
- Incorporate more sophisticated features and external factors affecting stock prices.
- Fine-tune models and explore ensemble techniques for enhanced prediction accuracy.
- Deploy models as web services for real-time stock price predictions.
